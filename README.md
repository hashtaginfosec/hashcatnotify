# hashcatnotify
 Plays a sound when new hashes are cracked by hashcat 

Big thanks WJDigby for https://github.com/WJDigby/hashms I just modified to it play a sound instead of Slack/SMS notifications. 
 
**Currently, hashcat.exe as process_name and hack-keyword.wav as sound are hardcoded in the file. **
